          <p><span>Summary:</span> The abstract submission period closes Friday, October 24, 2014. All notifications were sent in early November to the submitting authors. It is the submitting author’s responsibility to inform all co-authors of the status of the abstract.</p>
          <a class="accordion-toggle" href="#">Read all summary</a>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Abstracts must be 500 words or less. Use the spell checking and word count features of your word processor to check the text of the abstract before submitting. Each contributed abstract must be categorized under one of the topics or areas of interest described below. Authors are encouraged to submit abstracts from a variety of disciplines, methodological perspectives and approaches.</p>
            <p>Abstracts can be submitted to any track. However, you may NOT submit the same abstract to more than one track. Authors may submit only one abstract on which they are listed as the presenter. All abstracts must be received by Friday, October 24, 2014. An acknowledgement of receipt will be sent to the first author (the primary presenter) within three business days of submitting the abstract.</p>
            <p>All abstracts will be blind peer-reviewed and notification to presenting authors is expected to occur on Friday, November 7, 2014. Abstracts accepted for presentation at the summit will be published in the summit program book, accompanied with a brief bio & photo of the presenter.    At the time of submission, only the presenting authors are requested to complete all of the submission forms:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Conference Registration Form</li>
                <li>Speaker Agreement Form</li>
              </ul>
            <p>This information will only be used for those abstracts selected for presentation at the conference. Authors whose submissions have been accepted are expected to register and pay the conference registration fee after presenters have been notified of acceptance. Abstracts not accepted will be destroyed.</p>
            <p>The presenter author will be notified via e-mail of abstract status on Friday, November 7, 2014. Please make sure your e-mail address is correct and up-to-date. Please note: withdrawing an abstract after acceptance may prevent consideration of acceptance to future UCLA H3/BGRG Summits.</p>

              <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>There will be one type of presentation: single oral presentations. Oral sessions are 90 minutes. Single oral session abstracts will be accepted individually and combined into sessions by track chairs, typically four per session. Each speaker will have 20 minutes for his/her presentation. The track chairs attempt to combine abstracts of a similar topic into each session.<p>
                <p>• Single Oral Session</P>
                <p>Abstracts of individual papers will be considered for parallel sessions organized around a theme or topic, and will involve individual presentations of approximately 20 minutes in length (including discussion). Individual presentations of co-authored papers are welcome.</p>
