                <h3>SENIOR COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER</h3>

                <p>THE GLOBAL FORUM ON MSM &amp; HIV (MSMGF)</p><br/>
                <p>MSMGF AND OUR VALUES</p><br/>

                <p>The Global Forum on MSM &amp; HIV (MSMGF) was founded in 2006 at the Toronto International AIDS Conference by an international group of activists concerned about the disproportionate HIV disease burden being shouldered by men who have sex with men worldwide. The silence at that time about the toll HIV was taking on men who have sex with men was deeply troubling to many community members and advocates working at the frontlines.</p><br/>

                <p>The MSMGF remains the only global HIV advocacy network specifically devoted to the health and rights of gay men/MSM. Its network includes nearly 4,000 advocates and service providers representing over 1,500 organizations in more than 150 countries.</p><br/>

                <p>In recent years, the MSMGF successfully:</p><br/>

                <p>* Secured the inclusion and visibility of MSM in several high-level UN and PEPFAR HIV policy consultations and documents;</p><br/>
                <p>* Increased understanding of HIV among MSM globally through targeted community-based research, policy analysis and development of several publications;</p><br/>
                <p>* Convened stakeholders from every major region of the world and all levels of the HIV response to develop a collaborative global strategy to address HIV among MSM;</p><br/>
                <p>* Trained hundreds of MSM advocates and providers in Central America, East, North and West Africa, Middle East, and Southeast Asia;</p><br/>
                <p>* Produced high visibility Pre-Conference Events focused on the health and human rights concerns of men who have sex with men at the International AIDS Conferences in 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014;</p><br/>
                <p>* Developed a multi-lingual online knowledge hub populated with thousands of searchable research articles, which has received hundreds of thousands of visits since its launch in late 2010;</p><br/>
                <p>* Expanded regional and linguistic information exchange networks; and</p><br/>
                <p>* Increased global funding targeted to MSM at the country level, especially in Africa and other parts of the global south. For more details, see the MSMGF Annual Reports on the MSMGF’s About US webpage).</p><br/>

                <p>SUCCESS IN THIS POSITION</p><br/>

                <p>Under the direction of the Executive Director, the Senior Communications Officer works to develop the MSMGF’s brand consistency and build brand recognition among existing and potential donors and partners, both individual and organizational.
