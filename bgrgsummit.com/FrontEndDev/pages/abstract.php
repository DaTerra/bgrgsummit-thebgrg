              <h4 class="red-title">TRACK A: Advances in HIV Prevention Research</h4>
              <p>This track focuses on new research and innovative ways in addressing HIV-related health disparities in Black gay men&rsquo;s or Black same gender practicing men&rsquo;s communities (e.g., socio-cultural, behavioral, biomedical, prevention intervention research).</p>

              <h4 class="red-title">TRACK B: Black Queer Studies and Performing &amp; Visual Arts</h4>
              <p>This track focuses on the arts as a dynamic presence in our daily lives, enabling us to express our creativity while challenging our intellect. Through the arts, Black gay men or Black same gender practicing men&rsquo;s communities have a unique means of expression that captures their passions and emotions and allows them to explore ideas, subject matter, and culture in delightfully different ways. This track engages intellectual work that grapples with the current state of Black queer scholarship (e.g., What are the pedagogical strategies for teaching Black Queer Studies? How can technology and new media make Black Queer Studies and scholarship more accessible to a wider audience? How can Black Queer scholarship more adequately capture, depict, and represent the legacy of Essex Hemphill, Marlon Riggs and Joseph Beam 25 years after the publication of In the Life? How can we think about the genealogy of Black Queer Studies: a genealogy that has arguably been interrupted particularly by AIDS?).</p>

              <h4 class="red-title">TRACK C: Education &amp; Agency</h4>
              <p>This track focuses on how Black gay men and Black same gender practicing men navigate various educational spaces (in-school and out-of-school, conventional and alternative, K-12 and collegiate) in a variety of roles (students, teachers, administrators, parents, etc.), and how do they influence the production of knowledge within these spaces? What pedagogical strategies can address the social, emotional, and academic needs of Black gay males? How can educational research and practices work in tandem with efforts in public health, political organizing, and other fields to empower Black gay males? Through a broad conceptualization of educational processes, this track will focus on the potential for education to function as a site and source of agency for Black gay males.</p>

              <p>This track explores boundaries of nationality, language, scholarship, and practice in Black same gender practicing men&rsquo;s communities in Africa and the African Diaspora with a specific emphasis on addressing human rights (e.g., engaging critical analytic frameworks that address the complexities of macro- and micro level structural inequalities as situated in people&rsquo;s everyday lives).</p>

              <p>This track is designed to address public and institutional policy challenges and solutions as they relate to prevention efforts of HIV and other health issues, advocacy to improve prevention, and efforts that promote and further social justice. Possible areas of focus include critical policy analysis, advocacy, activism, political engagement and organizing, briefs, whitepapers, and other efforts focused on Black gay men&rsquo;s and Black same gender practicing men&rsquo;s communities.</p>

              <p>This track explores the multifaceted roles and lived experiences of religion and spirituality in Black gay men&rsquo;s or Black same gender men&rsquo;s communities (e.g., addressing issues related to stigma, marginalization, and structural inequalities related to institutionalized practices, resiliency and agency, challenging heteronormative social structures, etc.).</p>

              <p>Roundtable discussions involve oral presentations based on critical analytic engaged discussion with attendees seated around a table. Roundtable presentations typically include approximately 20 minutes of presentation, followed by 45 minutes of active discussion. Roundtable presenters should bring targeted questions to pose to others at the table in order to learn from and with those attending. Roundtables are an ideal format for networking and in-depth discussion on a particular topic.</p>
