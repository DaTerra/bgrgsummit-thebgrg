                <p>We will conduct four (4) focus groups with African American men who have sex with other men (MSM), (n=48) between the ages of 18 and 65 at the 2015 UCLA H3/Black Gay Research Group Summit and/or 2015 National African American MSM Leadership Conference in Atlanta, GA. For the sampling frame, we will seek to recruit African American MSM, and/or individuals who have expertise in aspects of how the domestic HIV epidemic continues to disproportionately affect African American MSM in the United States.</p>
				<p>
				The focus groups will ask the basic question “What do you feel are the current HIV prevention needs for gay/bisexual men who may be in relationships with someone of the opposite sero-status?” This information will help to provide some valuable data to explore what men in these relationships may need regarding HIV prevention while exploring important relationship dynamics unique to sero-discordant couples and support the continuing prevention agenda of the HPTN and HPTN MSM Community Working Group.</p>
